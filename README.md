# Machine-Learning/Deep-Learning
Some Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms/Problem Statements in python.
These problems were part of my Deep learning Course Assignments.

1. Linear_Reg_House_price - Consist of Closed form solution and Gradient Descent solution of Regression problem of House price prediction on Boston Dataset.

2. Polynomial Regression - Ipynb notebook illustrating Regression problem solved using fitting higher degree hypothesis to data using closed form solution

3. Polynomial_regr_grad_desc - Illustrates the Regression problem solution by fittih higher order hypothesis using gradient descent.

4. Mnist-CNN - A simple Convolutional Neural Network approach for handwritten digit classification on MNIST dataset.
